# Adopting-SwiftData-for-a-Core-Data-app
This sample project is designed to help you understand how to adopt SwiftData in an existing Core Data app. The SampleTrips app fetches and displays all upcoming trips from the store, and allows people to create or remove trips, and to add, update, or remove information from the itinerary for each trip. There are three versions of this app:
A Core Data version that demonstrates Core Data best practices.
A SwiftData version that shows the complete app conversion from Core Data to SwiftData.
A coexistence version, where the sample app uses Core Data, and adds a widget extension that uses SwiftData. This version covers a scenario where you might want to adopt SwiftData incrementally, or for certain portions of your app.
